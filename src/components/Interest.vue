              I have always liked to tinker with hardwares and computers ever since I was a child, to find out how things work and to be able to use computers to do all sorts of things always keeps me excited.
            </p>
            <p>
              I joined a coding bootcamp in Sydney for 3 months, and I was fully immersed with programming languages such as Javascript and Ruby. Also gained some knowledge of the relevant programming framework such as React and Ruby on Rails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following completed the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly and I felt ready to take on this new challenging coding career. Lucky I was offered a job to join a local tech company on the beautiful Gold Coast and work as a junior software developer. In my daily working life, I work with PHP, Laravel, and Vue. With only a limited experience and knowledge, it was definitely a challenge to work as a professional developer. Thatâ€™s why I decided to take this part-time course and hopefully a part-time degree in the near future toup my skills and knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              I often felt under-skilled in my daily working life, therefore I decided to join RMIT to pursue knowledge and a degree. Maybe I will even try to get a master degree in computer science.
